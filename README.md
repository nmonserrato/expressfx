## What is it
ExpressFX is a simple GUI for the `expressvpn` official linux command line.
It also vaguely looks like the official client.

It's really an excuse to experiment with Kotlin, TornadoFX, gradle and more stuff.

Finally, it's also a way to remember after login that I should connect to the VPN <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" width="24px"/>
